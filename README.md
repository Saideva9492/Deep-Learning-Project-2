# Deep-Learning-Project-2
This Project focuses on core concepts in deep learning, such as perceptron structure, network design, activation functions, decision surfaces, gradient descent, and practical programming tasks. The tasks require a combination of theoretical understanding and practical application using the Boston housing dataset.
